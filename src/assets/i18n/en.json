The New Year's eve was great, we've met a lot of people who were visiting as well, from many countries, no one knew each other but it was a really fun night and the firework was beautifull, the buildings was on fire and colorfull. The beach of St Kilda is a very nice place, we went by 42Â°, we got burned but worth it."
