The New Year's eve was great, we've met a lot of people who were visiting as well, from many countries, no one knew each other but it was a really fun night and the firework was beautifull, the buildings was on fire and colorfull. The beach of St Kilda is a very nice place, we went by 42Â°, we got burned but worth it.",

The next day we get a car and we have started our trip in Tasmania, driving to St Helens and 'The Bay Of Fire'...",

We bought a tent and decided to go camping by our own. We saw a wild wallaby but to far to take a picture. We have spend the rest of the day visiting around and tried to find wild animals. During the night some animals were around the tent we were a bit scared but it was funny. Next day we left the camping to Swansea where we booked a backpaker room.",
