        "photo1": "After we arrived on the 29th of december, we slept for 12 hours. The first week was a lot of visits, parcs, city center, chinatown, St Kilda... The New Year's eve was great, we've met a lot of people who were visiting as well, from many countries, no one knew each other but it was a really fun night and the firework was beautifull, the buildings was on fire and colorfull. The beach of St Kilda is a very nice place, we went by 42Â°, we got burned but worth it.",
        "photo2": "We arrived on the 10th of January, we have landed in Launceston, in Tasmania and we have visited the city and especially 'The Gorge' wich is a beautiful place. We stayed in a bagpacker accommodation and the personal was lovely. During the night we have met few people and we had dinner together and did a barbecue. The next day we get a car and we have started our trip in Tasmania, driving to St Helens and 'The Bay Of Fire'...",
        "photo3": "When we arrived in St Helens, we went to do shopping to get food and water, because we went in a camground, wich was free but in the nature and we needed to bring everything. We bought a tent and decided to go camping by our own. We saw a wild wallaby but to far to take a picture. We have spend the rest of the day visiting around and tried to find wild animals. During the night some animals were around the tent we were a bit scared but it was funny. Next day we left the camping to Swansea where we booked a backpaker room.",
